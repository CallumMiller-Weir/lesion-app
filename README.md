# lesion-app
## Overview
This project aspires to produce a mobile application capable of "diagnosing" pictured skin lesions.
This involves utilizing the [HAM10000 Dataset](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/DBW86T) to produce a machine learning model.
This model is then applied to test images taken by the user of the mobile application.
The output is a probabilistic assessment of medical conditions possibly present in images taken by the user.
## Motivations
This project serves as a programmatic introduction to machine learning, and machine learning tools used in industry.
## Design
The simple design is seen below.

## Technologies
The application will be written in Java, and TensorFlow will be used to produce a Machine Learning model.
